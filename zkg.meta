description = Genisys is a protocol defined by Union Switch & Signal for communicating with
	SCADA field devices, commonly used in the railway industry.
	It is similar in purpose to Modbus. Genisys was designed for use over serial
	connections, but is commonly transported over TCP as well.
	The protocol enables one client to communicate with one or more server devices
	over the same connection.  The servers are identified by a one-octet server address.
	"Genisys" is a trademark of Union Switch & Signal.
